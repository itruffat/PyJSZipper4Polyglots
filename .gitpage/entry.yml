  Focused on creating Polyglots (programs that can run on multiple interpreters), this repo can create a file to be read by up to 4 languages - Python, Javascript, Lua and Ruby!
  Functionality-wise, the zipper picks up programs in their original languages and then combines them in a very precise way so that the result will be valid in all languages.
  Not a very useful thing, but a really cool one!
